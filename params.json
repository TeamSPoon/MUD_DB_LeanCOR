{"name":"leanCoR","tagline":"A fork of LeanCoP that aims Description Logics reasoning","body":"### leanCoR\r\nSemantic Web technologies are a set of languages standardized by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and designed to create a web of data that can be processed by machines. One of the core languages of the Semantic Web is Web Ontology Language (OWL), a family of knowledge representation languages for authoring ontologies or knowledge bases. The newest OWL is based on Description Logics (DL), a family of logics that are decidable fragments of first-order logic. leanCoR is a new description logic reasoner designed for experimenting with the new connection method algorithms and optimization techniques for DL. leanCoR is an extension of leanCoP, a compact automated theorem prover for classical first-order logic. \r\n\r\n","google":"UA-311862-24","note":"Don't delete this file!
